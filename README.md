A simple app for developing games in inkjs. 

Opening an HTML file in Catmint will automatically recompile any ink files in that file's directory every time they're saved. Additionally, Catmint allows you to bypass browser security limitations that would normally block loading certain kinds of files from your file system.

To use, simply download the latest release [here](https://github.com/elliotherriman/catmint/releases). On macOS, you may need to right click the app, and click "Open".
